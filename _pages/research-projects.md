  A practical robot works under energy constraints. To cover a large area, it may not be able to finish the task in one iteration. It needs to visit a recharging station to get recharged and then continue the work. Multiple paths need to be planned, and the robot needs to be recharged between two paths.</p>

  We have presented two approximation algorithms to this problem with theoretical proof for the performance guarantee compared to the optimal solution. </p>

Another challenge in the applications of field robots is the disconnect between current theoretical results and practical applications due to the difficulty of obtaining maps for path planning. 

We build the maps for large, non-uniform environments by combining the aerial images with the ground robot energy-consumption measurements. Deep networks are applied to learn from the collected data and predict the energy-cost maps for the entire area [3-5], [7].
