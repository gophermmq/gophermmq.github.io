## Coverage path planning under energy constraints
<img src="/images/multi-paths.jpg?raw=true" alt="Photo" style="width: 60px;"/>
A practical robot works under energy constraints. To cover a large area, it may not be able to finish the task in one iteration. It needs to visit a recharging station to get recharged and then continue the work. Multiple paths need to be planned, and the robot needs to be recharged between two paths. 

We have presented two approximation algorithms to this problem with theoretical proof for the performance compared to the optimal solution
