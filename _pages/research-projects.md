  A practical robot works under energy constraints. To cover a large area, it may not be able to finish the task in one iteration. It needs to visit a recharging station to get recharged and then continue the work. Multiple paths need to be planned, and the robot needs to be recharged between two paths.</p>

  We have presented two approximation algorithms to this problem with theoretical proof for the performance guarantee compared to the optimal solution. </p>

To apply existing planning algoirthms to find energy-optimal paths, energy-cost maps are required. Howevern, how to obtain energy-cost maps, especially for large non-uniform fields, has not been sufficiently solved. 

We use the collaboration between aerial and ground robots for data-collection, and apply learn-based methods to predict energy-cost maps for the given environments.
