  A practical robot works under energy constraints. To cover a large area, it may not be able to finish the task in one iteration. It needs to visit a recharging station to get recharged and then continue the work. Multiple paths need to be planned, and the robot needs to be recharged between two paths.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 10px; clear: both;">
  We have presented two approximation algorithms to this problem with theoretical proof for the performance compared to the optimal solution. </p>
